Polygenic Trait$noun$withdef.39$A polygenic trait is one whose phenotype is influenced by more than one gene. Traits that display a continuous distribution, such as height or skin color, are polygenic. The inheritance of polygenic traits does not show the phenotypic ratios characteristic of Mendelian inheritance, though each of the genes contributing to the trait is inherited as described by Gregor Mendel. Many polygenic traits are also influenced by the environment and are called multifactorial.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=158
Sickle Cell Disease$noun$withdef.40$Sickle cell disease is a hereditary disease seen most often among people of African ancestry. Caused by mutations in one of the genes that encode the hemoglobin protein, the disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The mutation causes the red blood cells to take on an unusual sickle shape. Individuals affected by sickle cell disease are chronically anemic and experience significant damage to their heart, lungs, and kidneys.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=184
Fragile X Syndrome$noun$withdef.41$Fragile X syndrome is a hereditary disorder affecting mostly males. Symptoms include mental retardation, distinctive facial features, and poor muscle tone. The syndrome is caused by mutations in a gene on the X chromosome. Since males have a single copy of the X chromosome, they show symptoms if gene on their X chromosome is mutated. Females have a second, usually normal, copy of the gene on their other X chromosome. Consequently, they are less likely to show symptoms of the syndrome.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=67
Genetic Variation$noun$withdef.42$Genetic variation refers to diversity in gene frequencies. Genetic variation can refer to differences between individuals or to differences between populations.

Risk$noun$withdef.56$Risk, in the context of genetics, refers to the probability that an individual will be affected by a particular genetic disorder. Both genes and environment influence risk. An individual's risk may be higher because they inherit genes that cause or increase susceptibility to a disorder. Other individuals may be at higher risk because they live or work in an environment that promotes the development of the disorder.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=179
Codominance$noun$withdef.57$Codominance is a relationship between two versions of a gene. Individuals receive one version of a gene, called an allele, from each parent. If the alleles are different, the dominant allele usually will be expressed, while the effect of the other allele, called recessive, is masked. In codominance, however, neither allele is recessive and the phenotypes of both alleles are expressed.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=35
Non-Directiveness$noun$withdef.58$Non-directiveness refers to the nature of the genetic counseling process. According to the principle of non-directiveness, the genetic counselor has the responsibility to provide the client with accurate information about a test or outcome but should remain neutral and not try to influence the decisions made by the client.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=456
carrier screening$noun$withdef.59$Carrier screening is a type of genetic testing performed on people who display no symptoms for a genetic disorder but may be at risk for passing it on to their children. A carrier for a genetic disorder has inherited one normal and one abnormal allele for a gene associated with the disorder. A child must inherit two abnormal alleles in order for symptoms to appear. Prospective parents with a family history of a genetic disorders are candidates for carrier screening.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=24
Frameshift Mutation$noun$withdef.60$A frameshift mutation is a type of mutation involving the insertion or deletion of a nucleotide in which the number of deleted base pairs is not divisible by three. "Divisible by three" is important because the cell reads a gene in groups of three bases. Each group of three bases corresponds to one of 20 different amino acids used to build a protein. If a mutation disrupts this reading frame, then the entire DNA sequence following the mutation will be read incorrectly.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=68
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act$noun$withdef.61$The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is federal legislation that makes it unlawful to discriminate against individuals on the basis of their genetic profiles in regard to health insurance and employment.

Markers are used to track the inheritance of a nearby gene that has not yet been identified but whose approximate location is known. The marker itself may be a part of a gene or may have no known function.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=455
LOD Score$noun$withdef.70$LOD stands for "logarithm of the odds." In genetics, the LOD score is a statistical estimate of whether two genes, or a gene and a disease gene, are likely to be located near each other on a chromosome and are therefore likely to be inherited. A LOD score of 3 or higher is generally understood to mean that two genes are located close to each other on the chromosome. In terms of significance, a LOD score of 3 means the odds are a thousand to one that the two genes are linked, and therefore inherited together.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=531
DNA Fingerprinting$noun$withdef.71$DNA fingerprinting is a laboratory technique used to establish a link between biological evidence and a suspect in a criminal investigation. A DNA sample taken from a crime scene is compared with a DNA sample from a suspect. If the two DNA profiles are a match, then the evidence came from that suspect. Conversely, if the two DNA profiles do not match, then the evidence cannot have come from the suspect. DNA fingerprinting is also used to establish paternity.$http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=49
Knockout$noun$withdef.72$A knockout typically refers to an organism that has been genetically engineered to lack one or more specific genes.

Residuals can be positive (if the datum is above the line) or negative (if the datum is below the line). Plots of residuals can reveal computational errors in linear regression, as well as conditions under which linear regression is inappropriate, such as nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity. If linear regression is performed properly, the sum of the residuals from the regression line must be zero; otherwise, there is a computational error somewhere.$http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm

In this expression, the unconditional probability of A is also called the prior probability of A, because it is the probability assigned to A prior to observing any data. Similarly, in this context, P(A|B) is called the posterior probability of A given B, because it is the probability of A updated to reflect (i.e., to condition on) the fact that B was observed to occur.$http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm

slant$noun$withdef.183$A receiver route. In the slant route, a receiver runs straight upfield a few yards, plants his outside foot hard while in full stride, and turns 45 degrees towards the quarterback. A staple of the West Coast Offense (WCO) and the player may go as little as 2 yards or as many as 6 yards before moving inside for the pass. Variations include the quick slant in which the player plants and turns at the snap instead of running ahead first and the Slow or Zone route, in which the receiver runs 10 to 15 yards downfield to get behind the linebackers before turning.$https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_American_football
